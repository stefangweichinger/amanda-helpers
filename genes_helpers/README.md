## Gene's helper scripts

### backup and append meta-data

* backup.sh
* genes__helper.sh

Quote:

```
Find attached, the main backup.sh script I wrote the majority of 14 years 
ago. Make a link to it named flush.sh, it checks to see how it was 
called and changes its behaviour accordingly.

The idea was to append to an existing tape, just generated by amanda, the 
database and configuration that generated THIS backup, aiding our 
ability to do an uptodate, not a day old, bare metal recovery to a new 
disk, following a bare install to get the rest of the tools needed.

Cheers, Gene Heskett
