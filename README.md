# amanda-helpers

The idea is to collect and improve various helper scripts, tips and tricks around the Amanda backup suite.
People on the amanda-users mailing list come up with various enhancements for specific use cases, this knowledge is spread over the list archives, but should be collected and maintained in a more organized way (and maybe contributed to the amanda community version someday).
